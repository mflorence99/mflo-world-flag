## How to Use
The element uses an `iso2` property to set the country of the flag to be displayed. The encoding is [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2), with the convenience that it is interpreted case-insensitive.

```html
<mflo-world-flag iso2="gb">
</mflo-world-flag>
```

The country code can be set programmatically:

```javascript
var flag = document.querySelector("mflo-world-flag#the-right-one");
flag.iso2 = "de";
```

An `iso3` property is also supported. The encoding is [ISO 3166-1 alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3), with the convenience that it is interpreted case-insensitive.

## How to Style
Style `mflo-world-flag` as required by defining `--mflo-world-flag-theme` as show below. The flag icons have a nominal dimension of 48px and should not normally be shown at a larger size.

```css
mflo-world-flag {
  --mflo-world-flag-theme: {
    width: 24px;
  };
}
```

If you are styling `mflo-world-flag` from the local DOM, be sure to use `custom-style` to enclose your CSS. A simple `<style>` tag will not work, as discussed in the Polymer documentation under [Custom element for document styling](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/styling.html).

``` html
<style is="custom-style">
  mflo-world-flag { ... }
</style>
```
